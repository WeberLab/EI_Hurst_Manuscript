The study objective was to determine if the Hurst exponent (HE) – an estimate of the self-correlation and signal complexity of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal – is correlated with the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) ratio. Findings in this domain have implications for neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions with disrupted E/I balance, such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease. From a methodological perspective, HE is also considerably easier to accurately measure than E/I ratio. If HE can serve as a proxy for E/I, it may serve as a useful clinical biomarker for E/I imbalance. Moreover, E/I has been proposed to serve as a control parameter for brain criticality, which HE is believed to be a measure of. Thus, understanding if HE and E/I are correlated would serve to clarify this relationship. The study collected movie-watching and rest data including fMRI – which was used to calculate HE – and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) – which was used to measure inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters – GABA and glutamate, respectively. HE was found to increase with movie compared to rest, while E/I did not change between conditions. HE and E/I were not correlated during either movie or rest. This study represents the first attempt to investigate this connection *in vivo* in humans. We conclude that, at 3T and with our particular methodologies, no association was found.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThirty years ago, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) profoundly changed the world of MRI by allowing real-time analysis of pressing neuropsychological questions [@ogawaMagneticResonanceImaging1990; @ogawaBrainMagneticResonance1990; @stephanShortHistoryCausal2012]. While initially used to probe task-based responses, researchers have more recently developed an interest in studying brain function at rest, known as resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) [@decoRestingBrainsNever2013], i.e. to understand how brain dynamics at rest are related to neurological functioning as well as individual differences. A critical tool in analyzing these dynamics is the Hurst exponent (HE) [@campbellMonofractalAnalysisFunctional2022], a measure of self-similarity derived from the blood-oxygen-dependent (BOLD) signal. HE estimates the extent to which the BOLD signal displays long-term memory, where a higher value indicates a self-similar signal with long-term positive autocorrelations [@campbellMonofractalAnalysisFunctional2022; @beggsBeingCriticalCriticality2012]. Another way of understanding HE is that a signal with high HE is fractal: similar temporal signal fluctuations are observed, no matter the time scale [@campbellMonofractalAnalysisFunctional2022].\n\nHE has also emerged as a valuable tool in clinical research, capturing changes in BOLD signal dynamics across various neuropsychiatric conditions. In aging populations for instance, HE has been found to be elevated [@dongHurstExponentAnalysis2018; @winkAgeCholinergicEffects2006]; this relationship has also been found in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease [@maximFractionalGaussianNoise2005; @longBrainnetomeAtlasBased2018]. Additionally, changes in HE have been observed in conditions such as autism, mood disorders, and brain injury [@laiShiftRandomnessBrain2010; @donaTemporalFractalAnalysis2017; @weiIdentifyingMajorDepressive2013; @jingIdentifyingCurrentRemitted2017; @donaFractalAnalysisBrain2017]. These differences suggest HE may reflect changes in global and local functioning.\n\nUnderlying these observations is the critical brain hypothesis, which posits that the brain operates at a critical point, a state where order and disorder are perfectly balanced to enable optimal information processing [@decoRestingBrainsNever2013; @beggsBeingCriticalCriticality2012; @barangerChaosComplexityEntropy2000; @bassettUnderstandingComplexityHuman2011; @zimmernWhyBrainCriticality2020; @liangExcitationInhibitionBalance2024; @poilCriticalStateDynamicsAvalanches2012; @lombardiBalanceExcitationInhibition2017; @baumgartenCriticalExcitationinhibitionBalance2019; @bruiningMeasurementExcitationinhibitionRatio2020; @trakoshisIntrinsicExcitationinhibitionImbalance; @gaoInferringSynapticExcitation2017; @tianTheoreticalFoundationsStudying2022; @rubinovNeurobiologicallyRealisticDeterminants2011]. When operating at a critical point, the brain is maximally sensitive to external stimuli, and can dynamically transition between ordered and disordered states to promote efficient cognitive processing [@decoRestingBrainsNever2013; @beggsBeingCriticalCriticality2012; @tianTheoreticalFoundationsStudying2022; @rubinovNeurobiologicallyRealisticDeterminants2011].Recent papers suggest the control parameter underlying the brain’s ability to transition between states is the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) ratio, the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity, often operationalized as the ratio of the primary excitatory-to-inhibitory neurotransmitters, i.e. glutamate-to-GABA ratio [@liangExcitationInhibitionBalance2024; @lombardiBalanceExcitationInhibition2017; @baumgartenCriticalExcitationinhibitionBalance2019; @bruiningMeasurementExcitationinhibitionRatio2020; @trakoshisIntrinsicExcitationinhibitionImbalance; @gaoInferringSynapticExcitation2017]. It is thought that E/I controls criticality by modulating the brain’s signal-to-noise ratio [@liangExcitationInhibitionBalance2024; @rubensteinModelAutismIncreased2003].\n\nBesides the implications to the critical brain hypothesis, understanding if E/I is related to HE may allow for easier estimation of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, as accurate E/I measurement is technically challenging [@ajramContribution1HMagnetic2019]. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the only non-invasive method of measuring the ratio of glutamate (excitatory) to GABA (inhibitory) *in vivo* [@stanleyFunctionalMagneticResonance2018]. Unfortunately, it has both limited spatial and temporal resolution [@gaoInferringSynapticExcitation2017; @ajramContribution1HMagnetic2019; @stanleyFunctionalMagneticResonance2018]. Consequently, if HE could serve as a proxy for E/I, it would be much easier to estimate E/I in conditions of interest such as autism, Alzheimer’s, and schizophrenia.\n\nThere are a handful of studies suggesting a link between HE and E/I, however they are all either computational models or animal studies [@liangExcitationInhibitionBalance2024; @poilCriticalStateDynamicsAvalanches2012; @lombardiBalanceExcitationInhibition2017; @baumgartenCriticalExcitationinhibitionBalance2019; @bruiningMeasurementExcitationinhibitionRatio2020; @trakoshisIntrinsicExcitationinhibitionImbalance; @gaoInferringSynapticExcitation2017]. Moreover, their findings are inconsistent, with some reporting positive linear, negative linear, or U-shaped relationships between the two variables (see @tbl-lit). Thus, there is a need for further study, both to clarify the nature of a potential E/I-Hurst relationship, and also to confirm if this relationship indeed exists in the human brain. Therefore, the current study seeks to investigate the potential E/I-Hurst relationship in vivo, within the visual cortex during movie-watching and rest.\n\n| Citation | Study Type | HE Data Type | HE Calculation Method | E/I Type | E/I-Hurst Relationship |\n| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |\n| Poil et al.
