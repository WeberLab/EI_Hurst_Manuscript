  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects over 1:100 of the population and costs the UK more than {\pounds}32bn and the USA more than \$175bn ({\pounds}104bn) annually. Its core symptoms are social and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviours and sensory hyper- or hypo-sensitivities. A highly diverse phenotypic presentation likely reflects its etiological heterogeneity and makes finding treatment targets for ASD challenging. In addition, there are no means to identify biologically responsive individuals who may benefit from specific interventions. There is hope however, and in this review we consolidate how findings from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) add to the evidence that differences in the brain's excitatory glutamate and inhibitory {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) balance may be both a key biomarker and a tractable treatment target in ASD.},

  abstract = {Proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) complements other brain research methods by providing measures of neurometabolites noninvasively in a localized brain area. Improvements in MR scanner technologies, and data acquisition and analysis methods should allow functional (1)H-MRS (fMRS) to measure neurometabolite concentration changes during task-induced brain activation. The aim of the current study was to further develop event-related fMRS at 3T to investigate glutamate dynamics in response to repetition suppression. A secondary aim was to investigate the relationship between blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses and glutamate dynamics in the same paradigm at the same time. A novel approach of interleaved water-suppressed (metabolite) and unsuppressed (water) fMRS was used to simultaneously detect the event-related dynamics of glutamate and BOLD signal to repetition suppression in the lateral occipital cortex of thirteen (N=13) volunteers. On average, (1)H-MRS-visible glutamate increased after novel visual stimuli presentations by 12\% and decreased by 11-13\% on repeated compared to novel presentations. The BOLD signal, as measured by water peak amplitude changes, showed significant difference between Task and Rest trials, and, on a GLM based analysis of the time series, demonstrated a significant difference between the novel and repeated trials, however appeared to be decoupled from the glutamate response as no correlation was found between the two. These results are the first demonstration that reductions in neuronal activity typical of repetition suppression effects are reflected by reduced glutamatergic and BOLD measures, that glutamate and BOLD responses may not be coupled as previously thought, and that these changes and relationships can be measured simultaneously using event-related fMRS at 3T.},

Recent MRS investigations have adopted a functional approach, where acquisitions of MRS are performed over time to track task-related changes. Previous studies suggest glutamate is of primary interest, as it may play a role during cortical processing of noxious stimuli. The objective of this study was to examine the metabolic effect (i.e., glutamate) in the anterior cingulate cortex during noxious stimulation using fMRS. The analysis addressed changes in glutamate and glutamate\,+\,glutamine (Glx) associated with the onset of pain, and the degree by which fluctuations in metabolites corresponded with continuous pain outcomes. Results suggest healthy participants undergoing tonic noxious stimulation demonstrated increased concentrations of glutamate and Glx at the onset of pain. Subsequent reports of pain were not accompanied by corresponding changes in glutamate of Glx concentrations. An exploratory analysis on sex revealed large effect size changes in glutamate at pain onset in female participants, compared with medium-sized effects in male participants. We propose a role for glutamate in the ACC related to the detection of a noxious stimulus.},

Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

  abstract = {Background In functional magnetic resonance imaging, the brain's response to experimental manipulation is almost always assumed to be independent of endogenous oscillations. To test this, we addressed the possible interaction between cognitive task performance and endogenous fMRI oscillations in an experiment designed to answer two questions: 1) Does performance of a cognitively effortful task significantly change fractal scaling properties of fMRI time series compared to their values before task performance? 2) If so, can we relate the extent of task-related perturbation to the difficulty of the task? Methodology/Principal Findings Using a novel continuous acquisition ``rest-task-rest'' design, we found that endogenous dynamics tended to recover their pre-task parameter values relatively slowly, over the course of several minutes, following completion of one of two versions of the n-back working memory task and that the rate of recovery was slower following completion of the more demanding (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2) version of the task. Conclusion/Significance This result supports the model that endogenous low frequency oscillatory dynamics are relevant to the brain's response to exogenous stimulation. Moreover, it suggests that large-scale neurocognitive systems measured using fMRI, like the heart and other physiological systems subjected to external demands for enhanced performance, can take a considerable period of time to return to a stable baseline state.},

The brain, we argue, can be understood as a complex system or network, in which mental states emerge from the interaction between multiple physical and functional levels. Achieving further conceptual progress will crucially depend on broad-scale discussions regarding the properties of cognition and the tools that are currently available or must be developed in order to study mind--brain mechanisms.},

Statistical mechanics traditionally studied this transition with connectivity k as the control parameter and an exactly balanced excitation-inhibition ratio. While critical connectivity has been found to be low in these model systems, typically around k=2, which is unrealistic for natural neural systems, a recent study utilizing the excitation-inhibition ratio as the control parameter found a new, nearly degree independent, critical point when connectivity is large. However, the new phase transition is accompanied by an unnaturally high level of activity in the network. Here we study random neural networks with the additional properties of (i) a high clustering coefficient and (ii) neurons that are solely either excitatory or inhibitory, a prominent property of natural neurons. As a result, we observe an additional critical point for networks with large connectivity, regardless of degree distribution, which exhibits low activity levels that compare well with neuronal brain networks.},

This hypothesis, however, is still controversial. Here we will explain the concept of criticality and review the substantial objections to the criticality hypothesis raised by skeptics.

In this study, the metabolic demand of such a response was studied by measuring local metabolite concentration changes during a visual checkerboard stimulation using functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) at 7 Tesla. The results showed increases of glutamate and lactate concentrations during the positive BOLD response, consistent with previous fMRS studies. In contrast, during the negative BOLD response, decreasing concentrations of glutamate, lactate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were found, suggesting a reduction of glycolytic and oxidative metabolic demand below the baseline. Additionally, the respective changes of the BOLD signal, glutamate and lactate concentrations of both groups suggest that a local increase of inhibitory activity might occur during the negative BOLD response.},

  abstract = {Balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I) is a key principle for neuronal network organization and information processing. Consistent with this notion, excitation-inhibition imbalances are considered a pathophysiological mechanism in many brain disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, methods to measure E/I ratios in human brain networks are lacking. Here, we present a method to quantify a functional E/I ratio (fE/I) from neuronal oscillations, and validate it in healthy subjects and children with ASD. We define structural E/I ratio in an in silico neuronal network, investigate how it relates to power and long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of the network's activity, and use these relationships to design the fE/I algorithm. Application of this algorithm to the EEGs of healthy adults showed that fE/I is balanced at the population level and is decreased through GABAergic enforcement. In children with ASD, we observed larger fE/I variability and stronger LRTC compared to typically developing children (TDC). Interestingly, visual grading for EEG abnormalities that are thought to reflect E/I imbalances revealed elevated fE/I and LRTC in ASD children with normal EEG compared to TDC or ASD with abnormal EEG. We speculate that our approach will help understand physiological heterogeneity also in other brain disorders.},

Wavelets are naturally appropriate for analysis of biological data, such as functional magnetic resonance images of the human brain, which often demonstrate scale invariant or fractal properties. We provide a brief formal introduction to key properties of the DWT and review the growing literature on its application to fMRI. We focus on three applications in particular: (i) wavelet coefficient resampling or ``wavestrapping'' of 1-D time series, 2- to 3-D spatial maps and 4-D spatiotemporal processes; (ii) wavelet-based estimators for signal and noise parameters of time series regression models assuming the errors are fractional Gaussian noise (fGn); and (iii) wavelet shrinkage in frequentist and Bayesian frameworks to support multiresolution hypothesis testing on spatially extended statistic maps. We conclude that the wavelet domain is a rich source of new concepts and techniques to enhance the power of statistical analysis of human fMRI data.},

  abstract = {Background: Temporal fractals are characterized by prominent scale-invariance and self-similarity across time scales. Monofractal analysis quantifies this scaling behavior in a single parameter, the Hurst exponent (H). Higher H reflects greater correlation in the signal structure, which is taken as being more fractal. Previous fMRI studies have observed lower H during conventional tasks relative to resting state conditions, and shown that H is negatively correlated with task difficulty and novelty. To date, no study has investigated the fractal dynamics of BOLD signal during naturalistic conditions.Methods: We performed fractal analysis on Human Connectome Project 7T fMRI data (n = 72, 41 females, mean age 29.46 {\textpm} 3.76 years) to compare H across movie-watching and rest.Results: In contrast to previous work using conventional tasks, we found higher H values for movie relative to rest (mean difference = 0.014; p = 5.279 {\texttimes} 10-7; 95\% CI [0.009, 0.019]). H was significantly higher in movie than rest in the visual, somatomotor and dorsal attention networks, but was significantly lower during movie in the frontoparietal and default networks. We found no cross-condition differences in test-retest reliability of H. Finally, we found that H of movie-derived stimulus properties (e.g., luminance changes) were fractal whereas H of head motion estimates were non-fractal.Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that movie-watching induces fractal signal dynamics. In line with recent work characterizing connectivity-based brain state dynamics during movie-watching, we speculate that these fractal dynamics reflect the configuring and reconfiguring of brain states that occurs during naturalistic processing, and are markedly different than dynamics observed during conventional tasks.},

  abstract = {The following review will aid readers in providing an overview of scale-free dynamics and monofractal analysis, as well as its applications and potential in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neuroscience and clinical research. Like natural phenomena such as the growth of a tree or crashing ocean waves, the brain expresses scale-invariant, or fractal, patterns in neural signals that can be measured. While neural phenomena may represent both monofractal and multifractal processes and can be quantified with many different interrelated parameters, this review will focus on monofractal analysis using the Hurst exponent (H). Monofractal analysis of fMRI data is an advanced analysis technique that measures the complexity of brain signaling by quantifying its degree of scale-invariance. As such, the H value of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal specifies how the degree of correlation in the signal may mediate brain functions.

Scale-free signals follow a spectral-power curve of the form P(f\,)\,{$\propto$}\,f-{$\beta$}, where spectral power decreases in a power-law fashion with increasing frequency. In this study, we demonstrated that fractal scaling of BOLD fMRI signal is consistently suppressed for different sources of cognitive effort. Decreases in the Hurst exponent (H), which quantifies scale-free signal, was related to three different sources of cognitive effort/task engagement: 1) task difficulty, 2) task novelty, and 3) aging effects. These results were consistently observed across multiple datasets and task paradigms. We also demonstrated that estimates of H are robust across a range of time-window sizes. H was also compared to alternative metrics of BOLD variability (SDBOLD) and global connectivity (Gconn), with effort-related decreases in H producing similar decreases in SDBOLD and Gconn. These results indicate a potential global brain phenomenon that unites research from different fields and indicates that fractal scaling may be a highly sensitive metric for indexing cognitive effort/task engagement.},

  abstract = {Studies employing functional connectivity-type analyses have established that spontaneous fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals are organized within large-scale brain networks. Meanwhile, fMRI signals have been shown to exhibit 1/f-type power spectra - a hallmark of scale-free dynamics. We studied the interplay between functional connectivity and scale-free dynamics in fMRI signals, utilizing the fractal connectivity framework - a multivariate extension of the univariate fractional Gaussian noise model, which relies on a wavelet formulation for robust parameter estimation. We applied this framework to fMRI data acquired from healthy young adults at rest and while performing a visual detection task. First, we found that scale-invariance existed beyond univariate dynamics, being present also in bivariate cross-temporal dynamics. Second, we observed that frequencies within the scale-free range do not contribute evenly to inter-regional connectivity, with a systematically stronger contribution of the lowest frequencies, both at rest and during task. Third, in addition to a decrease of the Hurst exponent and inter-regional correlations, task performance modified cross-temporal dynamics, inducing a larger contribution of the highest frequencies within the scale-free range to global correlation. Lastly, we found that across individuals, a weaker task modulation of the frequency contribution to inter-regional connectivity was associated with better task performance manifesting as shorter and less variable reaction times. These findings bring together two related fields that have hitherto been studied separately - resting-state networks and scale-free dynamics, and show that scale-free dynamics of human brain activity manifest in cross-regional interactions as well.},

  abstract = {Purpose               We introduce FSL-MRS, an end-to-end, modular, open-source MRS analysis toolbox. It provides spectroscopic data conversion, preprocessing, spectral simulation, fitting, quantitation, and visualization.                                         Methods               The FSL-MRS package is modular. Its programs operate on data in a standard format (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative [NIfTI]) capable of storing single-voxel and multivoxel spectroscopy, including spatial orientation information. The FSL-MRS toolbox includes tools for preprocessing of raw spectroscopy data, including coil combination, frequency and phase alignment, and filtering. A density matrix simulation program is supplied for generation of basis spectra from simple text-based descriptions of pulse sequences. Fitting is based on linear combination of basis spectra and implements Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization for the estimation of the full posterior distribution of metabolite concentrations. Validation of the fitting is carried out on independently created simulated data, phantom data, and three in vivo human data sets (257 single-voxel spectroscopy and 8 MRSI data sets) at 3 T and 7 T. Interactive HTML reports are automatically generated by processing and fitting stages of the toolbox. The FSL-MRS package can be used on the command line or interactively in the Python language.                                         Results               Validation of the fitting shows low error in simulation (median error of 11.9\%) and in phantom (3.4\%). Average correlation between a third-party toolbox (LCModel) and FSL-MRS was high (0.53-0.81) in all three in vivo data sets.                                         Conclusion               The FSL-MRS toolbox is designed to be flexible and extensible to new forms of spectroscopic acquisitions. Custom fitting models can be specified within the framework for dynamic or multivoxel spectroscopy. It is available as part of the FMRIB Software Library.                        ,                             Click here               for author-reader discussions},

In this study, whole-brain fMRI measurements and localized functional 1H MEGA-PRESS MRS scans were conducted at 3T in healthy subjects prior to and during acute pain stimulation to quantify resting state GABA+/tCr and Glx/tCr levels in the insular cortex together with their stimulus-induced changes and to explore associations between these neurochemical parameters with intra-regional but also inter-regional BOLD responses. Inter-regionally, a significant negative correlation between the BOLD signal of a cluster in the supplementary motor area with overlap to the mid-cingulate cortex (R\,=\,-0.56, p\,=\,0.004) and the insular resting state GABA+/tCr was obtained. Furthermore, pain induced insular {$\Delta$}Glx was significantly positively associated with the BOLD signal in the left superior frontal gyrus, left and right inferior frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobe, left superior temporal gyrus, left anterior insula and right posterior insula, with R values ranging from 0.59 to 0.73 (p\,{$<$}\,0.005). No intra-regional association was observed between BOLD and metabolite measures. These findings point toward interactions between metabolite levels and stimulus-induced BOLD responses in brain regions belonging to the pain processing network. The combination of fMRS and fMRI provides a powerful tool to improve our understanding about the complex system of neurochemical processes and brain activity within brain networks.},

In this state, the functional networks are in a low firing stable state while they are continuously pulled towards multiple other configurations. Small extrinsic perturbations can shape task-related network dynamics, whereas perturbations from intrinsic noise generate excursions reflecting the range of available functional networks. This is particularly advantageous for the efficiency and speed of network mobilization. Thus, the resting state reflects the dynamical capabilities of the brain, which emphasizes the vital interplay of time and space.

  abstract = {Background Conventional imaging techniques are unable to detect abnormalities in the brain following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Yet patients with mTBI typically show delayed response on neuropsychological evaluation. Because fractal geometry represents complexity, we explored its utility in measuring temporal fluctuations of brain resting state blood oxygen level dependent (rs-BOLD) signal. We hypothesized that there could be a detectable difference in rs-BOLD signal complexity between healthy subjects and mTBI patients based on previous studies that associated reduction in signal complexity with disease. Methods Fifteen subjects (13.4 {\textpm} 2.3 y/o) and 56 age-matched (13.5 {\textpm} 2.34 y/o) healthy controls were scanned using a GE Discovery MR750 3T MRI and 32-channel RF-coil. Axial FSPGR-3D images were used to prescribe rs-BOLD (TE/TR = 35/2000ms), acquired over 6 minutes. Motion correction was performed and anatomical and functional images were aligned and spatially warped to the N27 standard atlas. Fractal analysis, performed on grey matter, was done by estimating the Hurst exponent using de-trended fluctuation analysis and signal summation conversion methods. Results and Conclusions Voxel-wise fractal dimension (FD) was calculated for every subject in the control group to generate mean and standard deviation maps for regional Z-score analysis. Voxel-wise validation of FD normality across controls was confirmed, and non-Gaussian voxels (3.05\% over the brain) were eliminated from subsequent analysis. For each mTBI patient, regions where Z-score values were at least 2 standard deviations away from the mean (i.e. where {\textbar}Z{\textbar} {$>$} 2.0) were identified. In individual patients the frequently affected regions were amygdala (p = 0.02), vermis(p = 0.03), caudate head (p = 0.04), hippocampus(p = 0.03), and hypothalamus(p = 0.04), all previously reported as dysfunctional after mTBI, but based on group analysis. It is well known that the brain is best modeled as a complex system. Therefore a measure of complexity using rs-BOLD signal FD could provide an additional method to grade and monitor mTBI. Furthermore, this approach can be personalized thus providing unique patient specific assessment.},

  abstract = {Background Brain connectivity in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has proven difficult to characterize due to the heterogeneous nature of the spectrum. Connectivity in the brain occurs in a complex, multilevel and multi-temporal manner, driving the fluctuations observed in local oxygen demand. These fluctuations can be characterized as fractals, as they auto-correlate at different time scales. In this study, we propose a model-free complexity analysis based on the fractal dimension of the rs-BOLD signal, acquired with magnetic resonance imaging. The fractal dimension can be interpreted as measure of signal complexity and connectivity. Previous studies have suggested that reduction in signal complexity can be associated with disease. Therefore, we hypothesized that a detectable difference in rs-BOLD signal complexity could be observed between ASD patients and Controls. Methods and findings Anatomical and functional data from fifty-five subjects with ASD (12.7 {\textpm} 2.4 y/o) and 55 age-matched (14.1 {\textpm} 3.1 y/o) healthy controls were accessed through the NITRC database and the ABIDE project. Subjects were scanned using a 3T GE Signa MRI and a 32-channel RF-coil. Axial FSPGR-3D images were used to prescribe rs-BOLD (TE/TR = 30/2000ms) where 300 time points were acquired. Motion correction was performed on the functional data and anatomical and functional images were aligned and spatially warped to the N27 standard brain atlas. Fractal analysis, performed on a grey matter mask, was done by estimating the Hurst exponent in the frequency domain using a power spectral density approach and refining the estimation in the time domain with de-trended fluctuation analysis and signal summation conversion methods. Voxel-wise fractal dimension (FD) was calculated for every subject in the control group and in the ASD group to create ROI-based Z-scores for the ASD patients. Voxel-wise validation of FD normality across controls was confirmed, and non-Gaussian voxels were eliminated from subsequent analysis. To maintain a 95\% confidence level, only regions where Z-score values were at least 2 standard deviations away from the mean (i.e. where {\textbar}Z{\textbar} {$>$} 2.0) were included in the analysis. We found that the main regions, where signal complexity significantly decreased among ASD patients, were the amygdala (p = 0.001), the vermis (p = 0.02), the basal ganglia (p = 0.01) and the hippocampus (p = 0.02). No regions reported significant increase in signal complexity in this study. Our findings were correlated with ADIR and ADOS assessment tools, reporting the highest correlation with the ADOS metrics. Conclusions Brain connectivity is best modeled as a complex system. Therefore, a measure of complexity as the fractal dimension of fluctuations in brain oxygen demand and utilization could provide important information about connectivity issues in ASD. Moreover, this technique can be used in the characterization of a single subject, with respect to controls, without the need for group analysis. Our novel approach provides an ideal avenue for personalized diagnostics, thus providing unique patient specific assessment that could help in individualizing treatments.},

  abstract = {Exploring functional information among various brain regions across time enables understanding of healthy aging process and holds great promise for age-related brain disease diagnosis. This paper proposed a method to explore fractal complexity of the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signal in the human brain across the adult lifespan using Hurst exponent (HE). We took advantage of the examined rs-fMRI data from 116 adults 19 to 85 years of age (44.3 {\textpm} 19.4 years, 49 females) from NKI/Rockland sample. Region-wise and voxel-wise analyses were performed to investigate the effects of age, gender, and their interaction on complexity. In region-wise analysis, we found that the healthy aging is accompanied by a loss of complexity in frontal and parietal lobe and increased complexity in insula, limbic, and temporal lobe. Meanwhile, differences in HE between genders were found to be significant in parietal lobe (p = 0.04, corrected). However, there was no interaction between gender and age. In voxel-wise analysis, the significant complexity decrease with aging was found in frontal and parietal lobe, and complexity increase was found in insula, limbic lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe with aging. Meanwhile, differences in HE between genders were found to be significant in frontal, parietal, and limbic lobe. Furthermore, we found age and sex interaction in right parahippocampal gyrus (p = 0.04, corrected). Our findings reveal HE variations of the rs-fMRI signal across the human adult lifespan and show that HE may serve as a new parameter to assess healthy aging process.},

However, other analysis approaches are required to fully characterize the regional signal dynamics contributing to these correlations between regions. In this study we show that analysis of the power spectral density (PSD) of regional signals can identify changes in oscillatory dynamics across conditions, and is able to characterize the nature and spatial extent of signal changes underlying changes in measures of connectivity. We analyzed spectral density changes in sessions consisting of both resting-state scans and scans recording 2 min blocks of continuous unilateral finger tapping and rest. We assessed the relationship of PSD and connectivity measures by additionally tracking correlations between selected motor regions. Spectral density gradually increased in gray and white matter during the experiment. Finger tapping produced widespread decreases in low-frequency spectral density. This change was symmetric across the cortex, and extended beyond both the lateralized task-related signal increases, and the established ``resting-state'' motor network. Correlations between motor regions also reduced with task performance. In conclusion, analysis of PSD is a sensitive method for detecting and characterizing BOLD signal oscillations that can enhance the analysis of network connectivity.

  abstract = {The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect that provides the contrast in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been demonstrated to affect the linewidth of spectral peaks as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and through this, may be used as an indirect measure of cerebral blood flow related to neural activity. By acquiring MR-spectra interleaved with frames without water suppression, it may be possible to image the BOLD effect and associated metabolic changes simultaneously through changes in the linewidth of the unsuppressed water peak. The purpose of this study was to implement this approach with the MEGA-PRESS sequence, widely considered to be the standard sequence for quantitative measurement of GABA at field strengths of 3 T and lower, to observe how changes in both glutamate (measured as Glx) and GABA levels may relate to changes due to the BOLD effect. MR-spectra and fMRI were acquired from the occipital cortex (OCC) of 20 healthy participants whilst undergoing intrascanner visual stimulation in the form of a red and black radial checkerboard, alternating at 8 Hz, in 90 s blocks comprising 30 s of visual stimulation followed by 60 s of rest. Results show very strong agreement between the changes in the linewidth of the unsuppressed water signal and the canonical haemodynamic response function as well as a strong, negative, but not statistically significant, correlation with the Glx signal as measured from the OFF spectra in MEGA-PRESS pairs. Findings from this experiment suggest that the unsuppressed water signal provides a reliable measure of the BOLD effect and that correlations with associated changes in GABA and Glx levels may also be measured. However, discrepancies between metabolite levels as measured from the difference and OFF spectra raise questions regarding the reliability of the respective methods.},

Having laid down the grounds of the basics in terminology and mathematical formalism, the authors systematically introduce the concept and methods of monofractal time series analysis. They argue that fractal time series analysis cannot be done in a conscious, reliable manner without having a model capable of capturing the essential features of physiological signals with regard to their fractal analysis. They advocate the use of a simple, yet adequate, dichotomous model of fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) and fractional Brownian motion (fBm). They demonstrate the importance of incorporating a step of signal classification according to the fGn/fBm model prior to fractal analysis by showing that missing out on signal class can result in completely meaningless fractal estimates. Limitation and precision of various fractal tools are thoroughly described and discussed using results of numerical experiments on ideal monofractal signals. Steps of a reliable fractal analysis are explained. Finally, the main applications of fractal time series analysis in biomedical research are reviewed and critically evaluated.},

Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each dataset, building upon a large inventory of available tools. The complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances in acquisition and processing. We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for fMRI data. fMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing without manual intervention. By introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative integration framework for software testing, we show that fMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality results on a diverse fMRI data collection. Additionally, fMRIPrep introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than observed with commonly used preprocessing tools. fMRIPrep equips neuroscientists with an easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing workflow, which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretability of results.},

Decreases in local GABA concentration and its release may facilitate this plasticity. Here we use in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to noninvasively measure serial changes in GABA concentration in humans in a brain region including the primary sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the hand used for an isometric motor sequence learning task. Thirty minutes of motor sequence learning reduced the mean GABA concentration within a 2 {\texttimes} 2 {\texttimes} 2-cm               3               voxel by almost 20\%. This reduction was specific to motor learning: 30 min of similar, movements with an unlearnable, nonrepetitive sequence were not associated with changes in GABA concentration. No significant changes in GABA concentration were found in the primary sensorimotor cortex ipsilateral to the hand used for learning. These changes suggest remarkably rapid, regionally specific short-term presynaptic modulation of GABAergic input that should facilitate motor learning. Although apparently confined to the contralateral hemisphere, the magnitude of changes seen within a large spectroscopic voxel suggests that these changes occur over a wide local neocortical field.},

  abstract = {Neural circuits sit in a dynamic balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I). Fluctuations in E:I balance have been shown to influence neural computation, working memory, and information flow, while more drastic shifts and aberrant E:I patterns are implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. Current methods for measuring E:I dynamics require invasive procedures that are difficult to perform in behaving animals, and nearly impossible in humans. This has limited the ability to examine the full impact that E:I shifts have in cognition and disease. In this study, we develop a computational model to show that E:I changes can be estimated from the power law exponent (slope) of the electrophysiological power spectrum. Predictions from the model are validated in published data from two species (rats and macaques). We find that reducing E:I ratio via the administration of general anesthetic in macaques results in steeper power spectra, tracking conscious state over time. This causal result is supported by inference from known anatomical E:I changes across the depth of rat hippocampus, as well as oscillatory theta-modulated dynamic shifts in E:I. Our results provide evidence that E:I ratio may be inferred from electrophysiological recordings at many spatial scales, ranging from the local field potential to surface electrocorticography. This simple method for estimating E:I ratio---one that can be applied retrospectively to existing data---removes a major hurdle in understanding a currently difficult to measure, yet fundamental, aspect of neural computation.},

The sensitivity of the method to errors in estimates of the different water compartment relaxation times is shown to be small at short echo times (TEs). Using data from healthy human subjects, it is shown that different image segmentation approaches that are commonly used to account for partial volume effects (SPM2, FSL's FAST, and K-means) lead to different estimates of metabolite levels, particularly in gray matter (GM), owing primarily to variability in the estimates of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fraction. While consistency does not necessarily validate a method, a multispectral segmentation approach using FAST yielded the lowest intersubject variability in the estimates of GM metabolites. The mean GM and white matter (WM) levels of N-acetyl groups (NAc, primarily N-acetylaspartate), choline (Ch), and creatine (Cr) obtained in these subjects using the described method with FAST multispectral segmentation are reported: GM [NAc] = 17.16 {\textpm} 1.19 mM; WM [NAc] = 14.26 {\textpm} 1.38 mM; GM [Ch] = 3.27 {\textpm} 0.47 mM; WM [Ch] = 2.65 {\textpm} 0.25 mM; GM [Cr] = 13.98 {\textpm} 1.20 mM; and WM [Cr] = 7.10 {\textpm} 0.67 mM.

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

METHODS: Sixteen male volunteers were investigated using magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy before, during and after experimentally induced dental pain. Biphasic bipolar electric current pulses of 1 ms duration were administered based on the subjectively determined pain threshold. Volunteers were instructed to rate every stimulus using a MR compatible rating scale. RESULTS: Due to the pain stimulation a significant absolute increase in glutamate (Glu, F\,=\,6.1; P\,=\,0.001), glutamine (Gln, F\,=\,11.2; P\,=\,0.001) as well as glutamate/glutamine (Glx, F\,=\,17.7; P\,=\,0.001) were observed, whereas myo-inositol (mI, F\,=\,9.5;P\,=\,0.001) showed a significant drop. Additionally, these metabolites showed a significant effect towards lateralisation, meaning that metabolic concentration differed either in left or right insular subdivision. Creatine demonstrated also an absolute significant decrease during stimulation (F\,=\,2.8; P\,=\,0.022) with a significant anterior-posterior difference (F\,=\,40.7; P\,=\,0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm that the insular cortex is a metabolically high active region in pain processing within the brain. Quantitative metabolic changes show that there is a distinct but locally diverse neurometabolic activity under acute pain. The known cytoarchitectonic subdivisions show different metabolic reactions and give new insights into pain-processing physiology.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether induced dental pain leads to quantitative changes in brain metabolites within the left insular cortex after stimulation of the right maxillary canine and to examine whether these metabolic changes and the subjective pain intensity perception correlate. METHODS: Ten male volunteers were included in the pain group and compared with a control group of 10 other healthy volunteers. The pain group received a total of 87-92 electrically induced pain stimuli over 15 min to the right maxillary canine tooth. Contemporaneously, they evaluated the subjective pain intensity of every stimulus using an analogue scale. Neurotransmitter changes within the left insular cortex were evaluated by MR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Significant metabolic changes in glutamine (+55.1\%), glutamine/glutamate (+16.4\%) and myo-inositol (-9.7\%) were documented during pain stimulation. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between the subjective pain intensity perception and the metabolic levels of Glx, Gln, glutamate and N-acetyl aspartate. CONCLUSION: The insular cortex is a metabolically active region in the processing of acute dental pain. Induced dental pain leads to quantitative changes in brain metabolites within the left insular cortex resulting in significant alterations in metabolites. Negative correlation between subjective pain intensity rating and specific metabolites could be observed.},

More recently, methods have been developed to estimate GABA free from MM contamination. In this study, the relationship between GABA acquired with MM suppression and conventional GABA+ measurements was examined. Methods GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS experiments with and without MM suppression were performed in the sensorimotor and occipital cortex of 12 healthy subjects at 3 Tesla. The correlation between GABA+ and MM-suppressed GABA measures was then determined. Results Across all data, a significant correlation between GABA+ and MM-suppressed GABA was found (r = 0.48; P = 0.02). Regionally, the sensorimotor voxel showed a trend toward a correlation of r = 0.53, P = 0.07 and the occipital voxel did not show a correlation, r = 0.058, P = 0.9. Conclusion GABA+ and MM-suppressed GABA are moderately correlated, but statistical power to reveal this relationship may vary regionally. The MM signal, while often assumed to be functionally irrelevant, appears to show inter-individual and inter-regional variance that impacts the correlation of GABA+ and MM-suppressed GABA.},

  abstract = {It has been shown recently that a significant portion of brain electrical field potentials consists of scale-free dynamics. These scale-free brain dynamics contain complex spatiotemporal structures and are modulated by task performance. Here we show that the fMRI signal recorded from the human brain is also scale free; its power-law exponent differentiates between brain networks and correlates with fMRI signal variance and brain glucose metabolism. Importantly, in parallel to brain electrical field potentials, the variance and power-law exponent of the fMRI signal decrease during task activation, suggesting that the signal contains more long-range memory during rest and conversely is more efficient at online information processing during task. Remarkably, similar changes also occurred in task-deactivated brain regions, revealing the presence of an optimal dynamic range in the fMRI signal. The scale-free properties of the fMRI signal and brain electrical field potentials bespeak their respective stationarity and nonstationarity. This suggests that neurovascular coupling mechanism is likely to contain a transformation from nonstationarity to stationarity. In summary, our results demonstrate the functional relevance of scale-free properties of the fMRI signal and impose constraints on future models of neurovascular coupling.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to present a cloud-based spectral simulation tool ``MRSCloud,'' which allows MRS users to simulate a vendor-specific and sequence-specific basis set online in a convenient and time-efficient manner. This tool can simulate basis sets for GE, Philips, and Siemens MR scanners, including conventional acquisitions and spectral editing schemes with PRESS and semi-LASER localization at 3 T. Methods The MRSCloud tool was built on the spectral simulation functionality in the FID-A software package. We added three extensions to accelerate computation (ie, one-dimensional projection method, coherence pathways filters, and precalculation of propagators). The RF waveforms were generated based on vendors' generic pulse shapes and timings. Simulations were compared within MRSCloud using different numbers of spatial resolution (21 {\texttimes} 21, 41 {\texttimes} 41, and 101 {\texttimes} 101). Simulated metabolite basis functions from MRSCloud were compared with those generated by the generic FID-A and MARSS, and a phantom-acquired basis set from LCModel. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the agreement between individual metabolite basis functions. Statistical analysis was performed using R in RStudio. Results Simulation time for a full PRESS basis set is approximately 11 min on the server. The interclass correlation coefficients ICCs were at least 0.98 between MRSCloud and FID-A and were at least 0.96 between MRSCloud and MARSS. The interclass correlation coefficients between simulated MRSCloud basis spectra and acquired LCModel basis spectra were lowest for glutamine at 0.68 and highest for N-acetylaspartate at 0.96. Conclusions Substantial reductions in runtime have been achieved. High ICC values indicated that the accelerating features are running correctly and produce comparable and accurate basis sets.},

The aim of the current study was to quantify neural activity using combined fMRI-MRS at 7T. BOLD-fMRI and semi-LASER localization MRS data were acquired from the visual cortex of 13 participants during short blocks (64s) of flickering checkerboards. We demonstrate a correlation between glutamate and BOLD-fMRI time courses (R=0.381, p=0.031). In addition, we show increases in BOLD-fMRI (1.43{\textpm}0.17\%) and glutamate concentrations (0.15{\textpm}0.05 I.U., {\textasciitilde}2\%) during visual stimulation. In contrast, we observed no change in glutamate concentrations in resting state MRS data during sham stimulation periods. Spectral line width changes generated by the BOLD-response were corrected using line broadening. In summary, our results establish the feasibility of concurrent measurements of BOLD-fMRI and neurochemicals using a novel combined fMRI-MRS sequence. Our findings strengthen the link between glutamate and functional activity in the human brain by demonstrating a significant correlation of BOLD-fMRI and glutamate over time, and by showing {\textasciitilde}2\% glutamate increases during 64s of visual stimulation. Our tool may become useful for studies characterizing functional dynamics between neurochemicals and hemodynamics in health and disease.},

Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.},

  abstract = {In recent years the field of fMRI research has enjoyed expanded technical abilities related to resolution, as well as use across many fields of brain research. At the same time, the field has also dealt with uncertainty related to many known and unknown effects of artifact in fMRI data. In this review we discuss an emerging fMRI technology, called multi-echo (ME)-fMRI, which focuses on improving the fidelity and interpretability of fMRI. Where the essential problem of standard single-echo fMRI is the indeterminacy of sources of signals, whether BOLD or artifact, this is not the case for ME-fMRI. By acquiring multiple echo images per slice, the ME approach allows T2* decay to be modeled at every voxel at every time point. Since BOLD signals arise by changes in T2* over time, an fMRI experiment sampling the T2* signal decay can be analyzed to distinguish BOLD from artifact signal constituents. While the ME approach has a long history of use in theoretical and validation studies, modern MRI systems enable whole-brain multi-echo fMRI at high resolution. This review covers recent multi-echo fMRI acquisition methods, and the analysis steps for this data to make fMRI at once more principled, straightforward, and powerful. After a brief overview of history and theory, T2* modeling and applications will be discussed. These applications include T2* mapping and combining echoes from ME data to increase BOLD contrast and mitigate dropout artifacts. Next, the modeling of fMRI signal changes to detect signal origins in BOLD-related T2* versus artifact-related S0 changes will be reviewed. A focus is on the use of ME-fMRI data to extract and classify components from spatial ICA, called multi-echo ICA (ME-ICA). After describing how ME-fMRI and ME-ICA lead to a general model for analysis of fMRI signals, applications in animal and human imaging will be discussed. Applications include removing motion artifacts in resting state data at subject and group level. New imaging methods such as multi-band multi-echo fMRI and imaging at 7T are demonstrated throughout the review, and a practical analysis pipeline is described. The review culminates with evidence from recent studies of major boosts in statistical power from using multi-echo fMRI for detecting activation and connectivity in healthy individuals and patients with neuropsychiatric disease. In conclusion, the review shows evidence that the multi-echo approach expands the range of experiments that is practicable using fMRI. These findings suggest a compelling future role of the multi-echo approach in subject-level and clinical fMRI.},

  abstract = {Background Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables investigation of the intrinsic functional organization of the brain. Fractal parameters such as the Hurst exponent, H, describe the complexity of endogenous low-frequency fMRI time series on a continuum from random (H = .5) to ordered (H = 1). Shifts in fractal scaling of physiological time series have been associated with neurological and cardiac conditions. Methods Resting-state fMRI time series were recorded in 30 male adults with an autism spectrum condition (ASC) and 33 age- and IQ-matched male volunteers. The Hurst exponent was estimated in the wavelet domain and between-group differences were investigated at global and voxel level and in regions known to be involved in autism. Results Complex fractal scaling of fMRI time series was found in both groups but globally there was a significant shift to randomness in the ASC (mean H = .758, SD = .045) compared with neurotypical volunteers (mean H = .788, SD = .047). Between-group differences in H, which was always reduced in the ASC group, were seen in most regions previously reported to be involved in autism, including cortical midline structures, medial temporal structures, lateral temporal and parietal structures, insula, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Severity of autistic symptoms was negatively correlated with H in retrosplenial and right anterior insular cortex. Conclusions Autism is associated with a small but significant shift to randomness of endogenous brain oscillations. Complexity measures may provide physiological indicators for autism as they have done for other medical conditions.},

We assessed anatomical and electrophysiological synaptic E/I ratios in post-mortem parietal cortex samples from middle-aged individuals with AD (early-onset) or Down syndrome (DS) by fluorescence deconvolution tomography and microtransplantation of synaptic membranes. Both approaches revealed significantly elevated E/I ratios for AD, but not DS, versus controls. Gene expression studies in an independent AD cohort also demonstrated elevated E/I ratios in individuals with AD as compared to controls. These findings provide evidence of a marked pro-excitatory perturbation of synaptic E/I balance in AD parietal cortex, a region within the default mode network that is overly active in the disorder, and support the hypothesis that E/I imbalances disrupt cognition-related~shifts in cortical activity which contribute to the intellectual decline in AD.},

Individual neurons spike irregularly, which is believed to originate from receiving balanced amounts of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, known as the excitation--inhibition balance. The spatial-temporal cascades of clustered neuronal spikes occur in variable sizes and durations, manifested as neural avalanches with scale-free features. These may be explained by the neural criticality hypothesis, which posits that neural systems operate around the transition between distinct dynamic states. Here, we summarize the experimental evidence for and the underlying theory of excitation--inhibition balance and neural criticality. Furthermore, we review recent studies of excitatory--inhibitory networks with synaptic kinetics as a simple solution to reconcile these two apparently distinct theories in a single circuit model. This provides a more unified understanding of multilevel neural activities in local circuits, from spontaneous to stimulus-response dynamics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical imaging data are typically stored and transferred in the DICOM format, whereas the NIfTI format has been widely adopted by scientists in the neuroimaging community. Therefore, a vital initial step in processing the data is to convert images from the complicated DICOM format to the much simpler NIfTI format. While there are a number of tools that usually handle DICOM to NIfTI conversion seamlessly, some variations can disrupt this process. NEW METHOD: We provide some insight into the challenges faced with image conversion. First, different manufacturers implement the DICOM format differently which complicates the conversion. Second, different modalities and sub-modalities may need special treatment during conversion. Lastly, the image transferring and archiving can also impact the DICOM conversion. RESULTS: We present results in several error-prone domains, including the slice order for functional imaging, phase encoding direction for distortion correction, effect of diffusion gradient direction, and effect of gantry correction for some imaging modality. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Conversion tools are often designed for a specific manufacturer or modality. The tools and insight we present here are aimed at different manufacturers or modalities. CONCLUSIONS: The imaging conversion is complicated by the variation of images. An understanding of the conversion basics can be helpful for identifying the source of the error. Here we provide users with simple methods for detecting and correcting problems. This also serves as an overview for developers who wish to either develop their own tools or adapt the open source tools created by the authors.},

  abstract = {The 1/f-like decay observed in the power spectrum of electro-physiological signals, along with scale-free statistics of the so-called neuronal avalanches, constitutes evidence of criticality in neuronal systems. Recent in vitro studies have shown that avalanche dynamics at criticality corresponds to some specific balance of excitation and inhibition, thus suggesting that this is a basic feature of the critical state of neuronal networks. In particular, a lack of inhibition significantly alters the temporal structure of the spontaneous avalanche activity and leads to an anomalous abundance of large avalanches. Here, we study the relationship between network inhibition and the scaling exponent {$\beta$} of the power spectral density (PSD) of avalanche activity in a neuronal network model inspired in Self-Organized Criticality. We find that this scaling exponent depends on the percentage of inhibitory synapses and tends to the value {$\beta$}\,=\,1 for a percentage of about 30\%. More specifically, {$\beta$} is close to 2, namely, Brownian noise, for purely excitatory networks and decreases towards values in the interval [1, 1.4] as the percentage of inhibitory synapses ranges between 20\% and 30\%, in agreement with experimental findings. These results indicate that the level of inhibition affects the frequency spectrum of resting brain activity and suggest the analysis of the PSD scaling behavior as a possible tool to study pathological conditions.},

  abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which generally represents the transition state between normal aging and the early changes related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), has drawn increasing attention from neuroscientists due that efficient AD treatments need early initiation ahead of irreversible brain tissue damage. Thus effective MCI identification methods are desperately needed, which may be of great importance for the clinical intervention of AD. In this article, the range scaled analysis, which could effectively detect the temporal complexity of a time series, was utilized to calculate the Hurst exponent (HE) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data at a voxel level from 64 MCI patients and 60 healthy controls (HCs). Then the average HE values of each region of interest (ROI) in brainnetome atlas were extracted and compared between MCI and HC. At last, the abnormal average HE values were adopted as the classification features for a proposed support vector machine (SVM) based identification algorithm, and the classification performance was estimated with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Our results indicated 83.1\% accuracy, 82.8\% sensitivity and 83.3\% specificity, and an area under curve of 0.88, suggesting that the HE index could serve as an effective feature for the MCI identification. Furthermore, the abnormal HE brain regions in MCI were predominately involved in left middle frontal gyrus, right hippocampus, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral amygdala, left cingulate gyrus, left insular gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, left orbital gyrus and left basal ganglia.},

The magnitude of the fluctuations of the rate of exocytic events about the mean decreases slowly as the rate is computed over longer and longer time periods, the periodogram decreases in power-law manner with frequency, and the Allan factor (relative variance of the number of exocytic events) increases as a power-law function of the counting time. These features are hallmarks of self-similar behavior. Their description requires models that exhibit long-range correlation (memory) in event occurrences. We have developed a physiologically plausible model that accords with all of the statistical measures that we have examined. The appearance of fractal behavior at synapses, as well as in systems comprising collections of synapses, indicates that such behavior is ubiquitous in neural signaling.},

Aside from these critical metabolic roles, glutamate plays a major part in brain function, being not only the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter, but also the precursor for {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid, the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter. Regulation of glutamate levels is pivotal for normal brain function, as abnormal extracellular concentration of glutamate can lead to impaired neurotransmission, neurodegeneration and even neuronal death. Understanding how the neuron-astrocyte functional and metabolic interactions modulate glutamate concentration during different activation status and under physiological and pathological conditions is a challenging task, and can only be tentatively estimated from current literature. In this paper, we focus on describing the various metabolic pathways which potentially affect glutamate concentration in the brain, and emphasize which ones are likely to produce the variations in glutamate concentration observed during enhanced neuronal activity in human studies.},

Two established paradigms, consisting of either a full-field or a small-circle flickering checkerboard, were employed to generate wide-spread areas of positive or negative blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses, respectively. Compared to baseline, the glutamate concentration increased by 5.3\% (p\,=\,0.007) during activation and decreased by -3.8\% (p\,=\,0.017) during deactivation. These changes were positively correlated with the amplitude of the BOLD response (R\,=\,0.60, p\,=\,0.002) and probably reflect changes of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. During deactivation, the glucose concentration decreased by -7.9\% (p\,=\,0.025) presumably suggesting increased consumption or reduced glucose supply. Other findings included an increased concentration of glutathione (4.2\%, p\,=\,0.023) during deactivation and a negative correlation of glutathione and BOLD signal changes (R\,=\,-0.49, p\,=\,0.012) as well as positive correlations of aspartate (R\,=\,0.44, p\,=\,0.035) and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (R\,=\,0.42, p\,=\,0.035) baseline concentrations with the BOLD response. It remains to be shown in future work if the observed effects on glutamate and glucose levels deviate from the assumption of a direct link between glucose utilization and regulation of blood flow or support previous suggestions that the hemodynamic response is mainly driven by feedforward release of vasoactive messengers.},

  abstract = {Fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) provides a parsimonious model for stationary increments of a self-similar process parameterised by the Hurst exponent, H, and variance, {$\sigma$}2. Fractional Gaussian noise with H {$<$} 0.5 demonstrates negatively autocorrelated or antipersistent behaviour; fGn with H {$>$} 0.5 demonstrates 1/f, long memory or persistent behaviour; and the special case of fGn with H = 0.5 corresponds to classical Gaussian white noise. We comparatively evaluate four possible estimators of fGn parameters, one method implemented in the time domain and three in the wavelet domain. We show that a wavelet-based maximum likelihood (ML) estimator yields the most efficient estimates of H and {$\sigma$}2 in simulated fGn with 0 {$<$} H {$<$} 1. Applying this estimator to fMRI data acquired in the ``resting'' state from healthy young and older volunteers, we show empirically that fGn provides an accommodating model for diverse species of fMRI noise, assuming adequate preprocessing to correct effects of head movement, and that voxels with H {$>$} 0.5 tend to be concentrated in cortex whereas voxels with H {$<$} 0.5 are more frequently located in ventricles and sulcal CSF. The wavelet-ML estimator can be generalised to estimate the parameter vector {$\beta$} for general linear modelling (GLM) of a physiological response to experimental stimulation and we demonstrate nominal type I error control in multiple testing of {$\beta$}, divided by its standard error, in simulated and biological data under the null hypothesis {$\beta$} = 0. We illustrate these methods principally by showing that there are significant differences between patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched comparison subjects in the persistence of fGn in the medial and lateral temporal lobes, insula, dorsal cingulate/medial premotor cortex, and left pre- and postcentral gyrus: patients with AD had greater persistence of resting fMRI noise (larger H) in these regions. Comparable abnormalities in the AD patients were also identified by a permutation test of local differences in the first-order autoregression AR(1) coefficient, which was significantly more positive in patients. However, we found that the Hurst exponent provided a more sensitive metric than the AR(1) coefficient to detect these differences, perhaps because neurophysiological changes in early AD are naturally better described in terms of abnormal salience of long memory dynamics than a change in the strength of association between immediately consecutive time points. We conclude that parsimonious mapping of fMRI noise properties in terms of fGn parameters efficiently estimated in the wavelet domain is feasible and can enhance insight into the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {The two-fold benefit of               1               H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at high               B               0               fields -- enhanced sensitivity and increased spectral dispersion -- has been used previously to study dynamic changes in metabolite concentrations in the human brain in response to visual stimulation. In these studies, a strong visual on/off stimulus was combined with MRS data acquisition in a voxel location in the occipital cortex determined by an initial functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. However, 1) to exclude the possibility of systemic effects (heartbeat, blood flow, etc.), which tend to be different for on/off conditions, a modified stimulation condition not affecting the target voxel needs to be employed, and 2) to assess important neurotransmitters of low concentration, in particular {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it may be advantageous to analyze steady-state, rather than dynamic, conditions. Thus, the aim of this study was to use short-TE               1               H MRS methodology at 7~T to detect differences in steady-state metabolite levels in response to a varying stimulation paradigm in the human visual cortex. The two different stimulation conditions were termed voxel and control activation. Localized MR spectra were acquired using the SPECIAL (spin-echo full-intensity acquired localized) sequence. Data were analyzed using LCModel. Fifteen individual metabolites were reliably quantified. On comparison of steady-state concentrations for voxel               versus               control activation, a decrease in GABA of 0.05~mmol/L (5\%) and an increase in lactate of 0.04~mmol/L (7\%) were found to be the only significant effects. The observed reduction in GABA can be interpreted as reduced neuronal inhibition during voxel activation, whereas the increase in lactate hints at an intensification of anaerobic glycolysis. Differences from previous studies, notably the absence of any changes in glutamate, are attributed to the modified experimental conditions. This study demonstrates that the use of advanced               1               H MRS methodology at 7~T allows the detection of subtle changes in metabolite concentrations involved in neuronal activation and inhibition.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Preterm birth causes alterations in structural and functional cerebral development that are not fully understood. Here, we investigate whether basic characteristics of BOLD signal itself might differ across preterm, term equivalent, and term infants. Anatomical, fMRI, and diffusion weighted imaging data from 716 neonates born at 23--43 weeks gestational age were obtained from the Developing Human Connectome Project. Hurst exponent (H; a measure of temporal complexity of a time-series) was computed from the power spectral density of the BOLD signal within 13 resting state networks. Using linear mixed effects models to account for scan age and birth age, we found that H increased with age, that earlier birth age contributed to lower H values, and that H increased most in motor and sensory networks. We then tested for a relationship between temporal complexity and structural development using H and DTI-based estimates of myelination and found moderate but significant correlations. These findings suggest that the temporal complexity of BOLD signal in neonates relates to age and tracks with known developmental trajectories in the brain. Elucidating how these signal-based differences might relate to maturing hemodynamics in the preterm brain could yield new information about neurophysiological vulnerabilities during this crucial developmental period.},

  abstract = {Water suppression is typically performed in vivo by exciting the longitudinal magnetization in combination with dephasing, or by using frequency-selective coherence generation. MEGA, a frequency-selective refocusing technique, can be placed into any pulse sequence element designed to generate a Hahn spin-echo or stimulated echo, to dephase transverse water coherences with minimal spectral distortions. Water suppression performance was verified in vivo using stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) localization, which provided water suppression comparable with that achieved with four selective pulses in 3,1-DRYSTEAM. The advantage of the proposed method was exploited for editing J-coupled resonances. Using a double-banded pulse that selectively inverts a J-coupling partner and simultaneously suppresses water, efficient metabolite editing was achieved in the point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) and STEAM sequences in which MEGA was incorporated. To illustrate the efficiency of the method, the detection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was demonstrated, with minimal contributions from macromolecules and overlying singlet peaks at 4 T. The estimated occipital GABA concentration was consistent with previous reports, suggesting that editing for GABA is efficient when based on MEGA at high field strengths.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the only biomedical imaging method that can noninvasively detect endogenous signals from the neurotransmitter {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the human brain. Its increasing popularity has been aided by improvements in scanner hardware and acquisition methodology, as well as by broader access to pulse sequences that can selectively detect GABA, in particular J-difference spectral editing sequences. Nevertheless, implementations of GABA-edited MRS remain diverse across research sites, making comparisons between studies challenging. This large-scale multi-vendor, multi-site study seeks to better understand the factors that impact measurement outcomes of GABA-edited MRS. An international consortium of 24 research sites was formed. Data from 272 healthy adults were acquired on scanners from the three major MRI vendors and analyzed using the Gannet processing pipeline. MRS data were acquired in the medial parietal lobe with standard GABA+ and macromolecule- (MM-) suppressed GABA editing. The coefficient of variation across the entire cohort was 12\% for GABA+~measurements and 28\% for MM-suppressed GABA measurements. A multilevel analysis revealed that most of the variance (72\%) in the GABA+~data was accounted for by differences between participants within-site, while site-level differences accounted for comparatively more variance (20\%) than vendor-level differences (8\%). For MM-suppressed GABA data, the variance was distributed equally between site- (50\%) and participant-level (50\%) differences. The findings show that GABA+~measurements exhibit strong agreement when implemented with a standard protocol. There is, however, increased variability for MM-suppressed GABA measurements that is attributed in part to differences in site-to-site data acquisition. This study's protocol establishes a framework for future methodological standardization of GABA-edited MRS, while the results provide valuable benchmarks for the MRS community.},

These novel findings are the first time a dynamic change in glutamate and glutamine levels from baseline in response to an external stimuli has been measured in a single proton MRS scanning session. As such, this report demonstrates the efficacy of (1)H-MRS as a non-invasive tool for the study of neural responses to pain in vivo. The paradigm used in this study demonstrates that dynamic glutamate/glutamine changes due to stimulation are measurable by proton MRS, and could provide a means of testing novel pharmaceutical agents and other treatments for chronic pain.},

Recently researchers have started to use MRS to measure neurotransmitter changes related to neural activity, so called functional MRS (fMRS). Particular interest has been placed on measuring glutamate changes associated with neural function, but differences are reported in the size of changes seen. This review discusses fMRS, and includes meta-analyses of the relative size of glutamate changes seen in fMRS, and the impact experimental design and stimulus paradigm may have. On average glutamate was found to increase by 6.97\% ({\textpm}1.739\%) in response to neural activation. However, factors of experimental design may have a large impact on the size of these changes. For example an increase of 4.749\% ({\textpm}1.45\%) is seen in block studies compared to an increase of 13.429\% ({\textpm}3.59) in studies using event related paradigms. The stimulus being investigated also seems to play a role with prolonged visual stimuli showing a small mean increase in glutamate of 2.318\% ({\textpm}1.227\%) while at the other extreme, pain stimuli show a mean stimulation effect of 14.458\% ({\textpm}3.736\%). These differences are discussed with regards to possible physiologic interpretations, as well experimental design implications.},

Here, we present Osprey, a fully integrated open-source data analysis pipeline for MRS data, with seamless integration of pre-processing, linear-combination modelling, quantification, and data visualization. New Method Osprey loads multiple common MRS data formats, performs phased-array coil combination, frequency-and phase-correction of individual transients, signal averaging and Fourier transformation. Linear combination modelling of the processed spectrum is carried out using simulated basis sets and a spline baseline. The MRS voxel is coregistered to an anatomical image, which is segmented for tissue correction and quantification is performed based upon modelling parameters and tissue segmentation. The results of each analysis step are visualized in the Osprey GUI. The analysis pipeline is demonstrated in 12 PRESS, 11 MEGA-PRESS, and 8 HERMES datasets acquired in healthy subjects. Results Osprey successfully loads, processes, models, and quantifies MRS data acquired with a variety of conventional and spectral editing techniques. Comparison with Existing Method(s) Osprey is the first MRS software to combine uniform pre-processing, linear-combination modelling, tissue correction and quantification into a coherent ecosystem. Compared to existing compiled, often closed-source modelling software, Osprey's open-source code philosophy allows researchers to integrate state-of-the-art data processing and modelling routines, and potentially converge towards standardization of analysis. Conclusions Osprey combines robust, peer-reviewed data processing methods into a modular workflow that is easily augmented by community developers, allowing the rapid implementation of new methods.},

The cause of the contrast has been attributed to a magnetic susceptibility effect induced by paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin in red cells. When the cylinder axis of a blood vessel is not parallel to the main magnetic field, the susceptibility difference produces varying local fields around the blood vessel. In gradient-echo images, not in spin-echo images, these local fields cause intravoxel dephasing of the water signal of the surrounding tissue. This description of the contrast enhancement has been confirmed by a series of in vitro blood sample experiments and image simulations. A predicted contrast change has been demonstrated in brain images of a mouse placed at two different orientations in the magnet. From the simulated images, the dependence of the contrast on the field strength has been estimated. {\copyright} 1990 Academic Press, Inc.},

Artifact-free, single-shot spectra were obtained from the human brain with a spectral pattern almost identical to that obtained with an ultra-short TE (TE = 5 ms) stimulated-echo acquisition mode (STEAM) sequence as a result of the train of adiabatic refocusing pulses in semi-LASER that reduce the apparent TE. Approximately 2-fold higher signal intensity relative to STEAM was demonstrated in phantoms and the human brain. To test the performance of the sequence in clinically relevant brain regions with a volume coil, semi-LASER spectra were acquired from three cerebellar and brainstem volumes of interest (VOIs) in 23 healthy subjects. Ultra-short echo STEAM spectra were acquired from the same VOIs to compare neurochemical profiles obtained with semi-LASER with those obtained with STEAM. Neurochemical profiles of the cerebellum and brainstem acquired by these two techniques were nearly identical, validating the accuracy of the metabolite concentrations obtained with semi-LASER at the longer TE relative to STEAM. A high correlation between metabolite concentrations obtained by these two proton (1) H MRS techniques indicated the sensitivity to detect intersubject variation in metabolite levels.},

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) can be used to investigate neurometabolic responses to external stimuli in-vivo, but findings are inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on fMRS studies of the primary neurotransmitters Glutamate (Glu), Glx (Glutamate + Glutamine), and GABA. Data were extracted, grouped by metabolite, stimulus domain, and brain region, and analysed by determining stan\- dardized effect sizes. The quality of individual studies was rated. When results were analysed by metabolite type small to moderate effect sizes of 0.29--0.47 (p {$<$} 0.05) were observed for changes in Glu and Glx regardless of stimulus domain and brain region, but no significant effects were observed for GABA. Further analysis suggests that Glu, Glx and GABA responses differ by stimulus domain or task and vary depending on the time course of stimulation and data acquisition. Here, we establish effect sizes and directionality of GABA, Glu and Glx response in fMRS. This work highlights the importance of standardised reporting and minimal best practice for fMRS research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A proposed mechanism of chronic pain is dysregulation between the main inhibitory (GABA) and excitatory (glutamate) neurometabolites of the central nervous system. The level of these neurometabolites appears to differ in individual studies of people with pain compared to pain-free controls across different pain conditions. However, this has yet to be systematically investigated. AIMS: To establish whether GABA, glutamate, glutamine and Glx levels differ across pain conditions when compared to pain-free controls. METHODS: Five databases were searched. Studies were included if they investigated: 1) A pain condition compared to control. 2) Reported GABA, glutamate, glutamine or glutamate/glutamine level. 3) Used 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (Prospero Project ID CRD42018092170). Data extracted included neurometabolite level, pain diagnosis, and spectroscopy parameters. Meta-analyses were conducted to establish the difference in neurometabolite level between participants with pain and pain-free controls for different pain conditions. The MRS-Q was developed from existing clinical consensus to allow for the assessment of quality in the included studies. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies were included investigating combinations of migraine (n\,=\,11), musculoskeletal pain (n\,=\,8), chronic pain syndromes (n\,=\,9) and miscellaneous pain (n\,=\,10). Higher GABA levels were found in participants with migraine compared to controls (Hedge's G 0.499, 95\%CI: 0.2 to 0.798). In contrast, GABA levels in musculoskeletal pain conditions (Hedge's G -0.189, 95\%CI: 0.530 to 0.153) and chronic pain syndromes (Hedge's G 0.077, 95\%CI: 1.612 to 1.459) did not differ from controls. Results for other brain neurometabolites revealed significantly higher levels for glutamate in participants with migraine and Glx in chronic pain syndromes compared to controls. CONCLUSION: These results support the theory that underlying neurometabolite levels may be unique in different pain conditions and therefore representative of biomarkers for specific pain conditions.},

  abstract = {The aim of this guideline is to provide a series of evidence-based recommendations that allow those new to using MEGA-PRESS to produce high-quality data for the measurement of GABA levels using edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy with the MEGA-PRESS sequence at 3T. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system and has been increasingly studied due to its relevance in many clinical disorders of the central nervous system. MEGA-PRESS is the most widely used method for quantification of GABA at 3T, but is technically challenging and operates at a low signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, the acquisition of high-quality MRS data relies on avoiding numerous pitfalls and observing important caveats., The guideline was developed by a working party that consisted of experts in MRS and experts in guideline development and implementation, together with key stakeholders. Strictly following a translational framework, we first identified evidence using a systematically conducted scoping literature review, then synthesized and graded the quality of evidence that formed recommendations. These recommendations were then sent to a panel of 21 world leaders in MRS for feedback and approval using a modified-Delphi process across two rounds., The final guideline consists of 23 recommendations across six domains essential for GABA MRS acquisition (Parameters, Practicalities, Data acquisition, Confounders, Quality/reporting, Post-processing). Overall, 78\% of recommendations were formed from high-quality evidence, and 91\% received agreement from over 80\% of the expert panel., These 23 expert-reviewed recommendations and accompanying extended documentation form a readily useable guideline to allow those new to using MEGA-PRESS to design appropriate MEGA-PRESS study protocols and generate high-quality data., Image 1, {$\bullet$}Evidence-based, translational guideline for measuring GABA using MEGA-PRESS.{$\bullet$}Developed using translational framework by end-users, MRS and implementation experts.{$\bullet$}Contains 23 recommendations across six domains essential for GABA MRS.{$\bullet$}Each recommendation was graded for quality of evidence and approval of 21 experts.{$\bullet$}The package includes this manuscript, infographic and stylised extended guideline.},

  abstract = {Criticality has gained widespread interest in neuroscience as an attractive framework for understanding the character and functional implications of variability in brain activity. The metastability of critical systems maximizes their dynamic range, storage capacity, and computational power. Power-law scaling---a hallmark of criticality---has been observed on different levels, e.g., in the distribution of neuronal avalanches in vitro and in vivo, but also in the decay of temporal correlations in behavioral performance and ongoing oscillations in humans. An unresolved issue is whether power-law scaling on different organizational levels in the brain---and possibly in other hierarchically organized systems---can be related. Here, we show that critical-state dynamics of avalanches and oscillations jointly emerge in a neuronal network model when excitation and inhibition is balanced. The oscillatory activity of the model was qualitatively similar to what is typically observed in recordings of human resting-state MEG. We propose that homeostatic plasticity mechanisms tune this balance in healthy brain networks, and that it is essential for critical behavior on multiple levels of neuronal organization with ensuing functional benefits. Based on our network model, we introduce a concept of multi-level criticality in which power-law scaling can emerge on multiple time scales in oscillating networks.},

The dependence of the CNR on T2*, the image encoding time, and the number of sampled echo times are investigated for exponential fitting, echo summation, weighted echo summation, and averaging of correlation maps obtained at different echo times. The method is validated in vivo using visual stimulation and turbo proton echoplanar spectroscopic imaging (turbo-PEPSI), a new single-shot multi-slice MR spectroscopic imaging technique, which acquires up to 12 consecutive echoplanar images with echo times ranging from 12 to 213 msec. Quantitative T2*-mapping significantly increases the measured extent of activation and the mean correlation coefficient compared with conventional echoplanar imaging. The sensitivity gain with echo summation, which is computationally efficient provides similar sensitivity as fitting. For all data processing methods sensitivity is optimum when echo times up to 3.2 T2* are sampled. This methodology has implications for comparing functional sensitivity at different magnetic field strengths and between brain regions with different magnetic field inhomogeneities.},

Many conditions are known to exhibit a disturbance in Glu-Gln equilibrium and the exact relationship between these changed conditions and these amino acids are not fully understood. This has led to increased interest in Glu/Gln quantitation in the human brain in an array of conditions (e.g. mental illness, tumor, neuro-degeneration) as well as in normal brain function., Accordingly, this review has been undertaken to describe the increasing number of in vivo techniques available to study Glu and Gln separately, or pooled as `Glx'. The present range of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) methods used to assess Glu and Gln, vary in approach, complexity and outcome, thus the focus of this review is on a description of MRS acquisition approaches, and an indication of relative utility of each technique rather than brain pathologies associated to Glu and/or Gln perturbation. Consequently, this review focuses particularly on (1) one-dimensional (1D) 1H MRS, (2) two-dimensional (2D) 1H MRS, and (3) 1D 13C MRS techniques.},

In magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies, the ratio of excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory ({$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid, GABA) neurotransmitters is often used as a proxy for this E/I balance. Recent MRS work found a positive correlation between GABA+ and Glx (glutamate+glutamine) in medial parietal cortex, providing validation for this proxy and supporting the link between the E/I balance observed in electrophysiology and that detected with MRS. Here we assess the same relationship, between GABA+ and Glx, in visual and motor cortices of male and female human participants. We find moderate to strong evidence that there is no positive correlation between these neurotransmitters in either location. We show this holds true when controlling for a range of other factors (i.e., demographics, signal quality, tissue composition, other neurochemicals) and regardless of the state of neural activity (i.e., resting/active). These results show that there is no brain-wide balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and indicates a dissociation between the E/I balance observed in electrophysiological work and the ratio of MRS-detected neurotransmitters.},

Despite recent advances in identifying some genes that can cause autism, its underlying neurological mechanisms are uncertain. Autism is best conceptualized by considering the neural systems that may be defective in autistic individuals. Recent advances in understanding neural systems that process sensory information, various types of memories and social and emotional behaviors are reviewed and compared with known abnormalities in autism. Then, specific genetic abnormalities that are linked with autism are examined. Synthesis of this information leads to a model that postulates that some forms of autism are caused by an increased ratio of excitation/ inhibition in sensory, mnemonic, social and emotional systems. The model further postulates that the increased ratio of excitation/inhibition can be caused by combinatorial effects of genetic and environmental variables that impinge upon a given neural system. Furthermore, the model suggests potential therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Self-organized criticality refers to the spontaneous emergence of self-similar dynamics in complex systems poised between order and randomness. The presence of self-organized critical dynamics in the brain is theoretically appealing and is supported by recent neurophysiological studies. Despite this, the neurobiological determinants of these dynamics have not been previously sought. Here, we systematically examined the influence of such determinants in hierarchically modular networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity and axonal conduction delays. We characterized emergent dynamics in our networks by distributions of active neuronal ensemble modules (neuronal avalanches) and rigorously assessed these distributions for power-law scaling. We found that spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity enabled a rapid phase transition from random subcritical dynamics to ordered supercritical dynamics. Importantly, modular connectivity and low wiring cost broadened this transition, and enabled a regime indicative of self-organized criticality. The regime only occurred when modular connectivity, low wiring cost and synaptic plasticity were simultaneously present, and the regime was most evident when between-module connection density scaled as a power-law. The regime was robust to variations in other neurobiologically relevant parameters and favored systems with low external drive and strong internal interactions. Increases in system size and connectivity facilitated internal interactions, permitting reductions in external drive and facilitating convergence of postsynaptic-response magnitude and synaptic-plasticity learning rate parameter values towards neurobiologically realistic levels. We hence infer a novel association between self-organized critical neuronal dynamics and several neurobiologically realistic features of structural connectivity. The central role of these features in our model may reflect their importance for neuronal information processing.},

The scaling exponent {$\beta$} is thus often interpreted as a ``biomarker'' of relative health and decline. New Method This paper presents a thorough comparative numerical analysis of fractal characterization techniques with specific consideration given to experimentally measured gait stride interval time series. The ideal fractal signals generated in the numerical analysis are constrained under varying lengths and biases indicative of a range of physiologically conceivable fractal signals. This analysis is to complement previous investigations of fractal characteristics in healthy and pathological gait stride interval time series, with which this study is compared. Results The results of our analysis showed that the averaged wavelet coefficient method consistently yielded the most accurate results. Comparison with Existing Methods: Class dependent methods proved to be unsuitable for physiological time series. Detrended fluctuation analysis as most prevailing method in the literature exhibited large estimation variances. Conclusions The comparative numerical analysis and experimental applications provide a thorough basis for determining an appropriate and robust method for measuring and comparing a physiologically meaningful biomarker, the spectral index {$\beta$}. In consideration of the constraints of application, we note the significant drawbacks of detrended fluctuation analysis and conclude that the averaged wavelet coefficient method can provide reasonable consistency and accuracy for characterizing these fractal time series.},

Therefore, the present study confirms that lactate and glutamate changes during physiological stimulation are small (i.e. below 20\%) and shows that the increased sensitivity allows reproduction of previous results with fewer subjects. In addition, the initial rate of glutamate and lactate concentration increases implies an increase in CMRO2 that is slightly below that of CMRGlc during the first 1-2 min of activation.},

  abstract = {Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) is a well-established technique for quantifying the brain regional biochemistry in vivo. In most studies, however, the 1H MRS is acquired during rest with little to no constraint on behavior. Measured metabolite levels, therefore, reflect steady-state concentrations whose associations with behavior and cognition are unclear. With the recent advances in MR technology---higher-field MR systems, robust acquisition techniques and sophisticated quantification methods---1H MRS is now experiencing a resurgence. It is sensitive to task-related and pathology-relevant regional dynamic changes in neurotransmitters, including the most ubiquitous among them, glutamate. Moreover, high temporal resolution approaches allow tracking glutamate modulations at a time scale of under a minute during perceptual, motor, and cognitive tasks. The observed task-related changes in brain glutamate are consistent with new metabolic steady states reflecting the neural output driven by shifts in the local excitatory and inhibitory balance on local circuits. Unlike blood oxygen level differences-base functional MRI, this form of in vivo MRS, also known as functional MRS (1H fMRS), yields a more direct measure of behaviorally relevant neural activity and is considerably less sensitive to vascular changes. 1H fMRS enables noninvasive investigations of task-related glutamate changes that are relevant to normal and impaired cognitive performance, and psychiatric disorders. By targeting brain glutamate, this approach taps into putative neural correlates of synaptic plasticity. This review provides a concise survey of recent technological advancements that lay the foundation for the successful use of 1H fMRS in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychiatry, including a review of seminal 1H fMRS studies, and the discussion of biological significance of task-related changes in glutamate modulation. We conclude with a discussion of the promises, limitations, and outstanding challenges of this new tool in the armamentarium of cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry research.},

  abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

  abstract = {Criticality is hypothesized as a physical mechanism underlying efficient transitions between cortical states and remarkable information-processing capacities in the brain. While considerable evidence generally supports this hypothesis, nonnegligible controversies persist regarding the ubiquity of criticality in neural dynamics and its role in information processing. Validity issues frequently arise during identifying potential brain criticality from empirical data. Moreover, the functional benefits implied by brain criticality are frequently misconceived or unduly generalized. These problems stem from the nontriviality and immaturity of the physical theories that analytically derive brain criticality and the statistic techniques that estimate brain criticality from empirical data. To help solve these problems, we present a systematic review and reformulate the foundations of studying brain criticality, that is, ordinary criticality (OC), quasi-criticality (qC), self-organized criticality (SOC), and self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC), using the terminology of neuroscience. We offer accessible explanations of the physical theories and statistical techniques of brain criticality, providing step-by-step derivations to characterize neural dynamics as a physical system with avalanches. We summarize error-prone details and existing limitations in brain criticality analysis and suggest possible solutions. Moreover, we present a forward-looking perspective on how optimizing the foundations of studying brain criticality can deepen our understanding of various neuroscience questions., The brain criticality hypothesis is one of the most focused and controversial topics in neuroscience and biophysics. This research develops a unified framework to reformulate the physics theories of four basic types of brain criticality, ordinary criticality (OC), quasi-criticality (qC), self-organized criticality (SOC), and self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC), into more accessible and neuroscience-related forms. For the statistic techniques used to validate the brain criticality hypothesis, we also present comprehensive explanations of them, summarize their error-prone details, and suggest possible solutions. This framework may help resolve potential controversies in studying the brain criticality hypothesis, especially those arising from the misconceptions about the theoretical foundations of brain criticality.},

  abstract = {Excitation-inhibition (E:I) imbalance is theorized as an important pathophysiological mechanism in autism. Autism affects males more frequently than females and sex-related mechanisms (e.g., X-linked genes, androgen hormones) can influence E:I balance. This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females. This work suggests that H in BOLD can index synaptic E:I ratio and that E:I imbalance affects autistic males and females differently., Autism is a condition that is usually diagnosed early in life that affects how a person communicates and socializes, and is often characterized by repetitive behaviors. One key theory of autism is that it reflects an imbalance in levels of excitation and inhibition in the brain. Excitatory signals are those that make other brain cells more likely to become active; inhibitory signals have the opposite effect. In non-autistic individuals, inhibitory activity outweighs excitatory activity. In people with autism, by contrast, an increase in excitatory activity is believed to produce an imbalance in excitation and inhibition., Most of the evidence to support this excitation-inhibition imbalance theory has come from studies of rare mutations that cause autism. Many of these mutations occur on the sex chromosomes or are influenced by androgen hormones (hormones that usually play a role on typically male traits). However, most people with autism do not possess these particular mutations. It was thus unclear whether the theory could apply to everyone with autism or, for example, whether it may better apply to specific groups of individuals based on their sex or gender. This is especially important given that about four times as many men and boys compared to women and girls are diagnosed with autism., Trakoshis, Mart{\'i}nez-Ca{\~n}ada et al. have now found a way to ask whether any imbalance in excitation and inhibition in the brain occurs differently in men and women. Using computer modeling, they identified a signal in brain scans that corresponds to an imbalance of excitation and inhibition. After showing that the technique works to identify real increases in excitation in the brain scans of mice, Trakoshis, Mart{\'i}nez-Ca{\~n}ada et al. looked for this signal, or biomarker, in brain scans of people with and without autism. All the people in the study identified with the gender that matched the sex they were assigned at birth. The results revealed differences between the men and women with autism. Men with autism showed an imbalance in excitation and inhibition in specific `social brain' regions including the medial prefrontal cortex, but women with autism did not. Notably, many of these brain regions are strongly affected by androgen hormones., Previous studies have found that women with autism are sometimes better at hiding or `camouflaging' their difficulties when socializing or communicating than men with autism. Trakoshis, Mart{\'i}nez-Ca{\~n}ada et al. showed that the better a woman was at camouflaging her autism, the more her brain activity in this region resembled that of non-autistic women., Excitation-inhibition imbalance may thus affect specific brain regions involved in socializing and communication more in men who have autism than in women with the condition. Balanced excitation and inhibition in these brain areas may enable some women with autism to camouflage their difficulties socializing or communicating. Being able to detect imbalances in activity using standard brain imaging could be useful for clinical trials. Future studies could use this biomarker to monitor responses to drug treatments that aim to adjust the balance between excitation and inhibition.},

  abstract = {The excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio has been shown to be imbalanced in individuals diagnosed with autism (AT) or schizophrenia (SZ), relative to neurotypically developed controls (TD). However, the degree of E/I imbalance overlap between SZ and AT has not been extensively compared. Our main objectives were (1) to quantify group differences in the E/I ratio between TD, AT, and SZ, (2) to assess the potential of the E/I ratio for differential diagnosis, and (3) to verify the replicability of our findings in a second, independently-acquired dataset. For each participant, we computed the Hurst exponent (H), an indicator of the E/I ratio, from the timecourses of 53 independent components covering the entire brain. Using Random Forest (RF), we ran a classification analysis using the largerof the two datasets (exploratory dataset; 519 TD, 200 AT, 355 SZ) to determine which of the 53 H would yield the highest performance in classifying SZ and AT. Next, taking the ten most important H from the exploratory dataset and the clinical and phenotypic information collected in the replication dataset (55 TD, 30 AT, 39 SZ), we used RF to compare classification performance using five feature sets: (a) H only; (b) Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) only; (c) PANSS, ADOS, Bermond--Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire (BVAQ), Empathy Quotient (EQ), and IQ; (d) H, PANSS and ADOS; (e) H, PANSS, ADOS, BVAQ, EQ and IQ. Classification performance using H only was higher in the exploratory dataset (AUC = 84\%) compared to the replication dataset (AUC = 72\%). In the replication dataset, the highest classification performance was obtained when combining H with PANSS, ADOS, BVAQ, EQ and IQ (i.e., model e; AUC = 83\%).},

  abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) have revealed abnormalities of functional connectivity within or among the resting-state networks. They provide valuable insight into the pathological mechanisms of depression. However, few reports were involved in the ``long-term memory'' of fMRI signals. This study was to investigate the ``long-term memory'' of resting-state networks by calculating their Hurst exponents for identifying depressed patients from healthy controls. Resting-state networks were extracted from fMRI data of 20 MDD and 20 matched healthy control subjects. The Hurst exponent of each network was estimated by Range Scale analysis for further discriminant analysis. 95\% of depressed patients and 85\% of healthy controls were correctly classified by Support Vector Machine with an accuracy of 90\%. The right fronto-parietal and default mode network constructed a deficit network (lower memory and more irregularity in MDD), while the left fronto-parietal, ventromedial prefrontal and salience network belonged to an excess network (longer memory in MDD), suggesting these dysfunctional networks may be related to a portion of the complex of emotional and cognitive disturbances. The abnormal ``long-term memory'' of resting-state networks associated with depression may provide a new possibility towards the exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms of MDD.},

  abstract = {Proton MRS (               1               H MRS) provides noninvasive, quantitative metabolite profiles of tissue and has been shown to aid the clinical management of several brain diseases. Although most modern clinical MR scanners support MRS capabilities, routine use is largely restricted to specialized centers with good access to MR research support. Widespread adoption has been slow for several reasons, and technical challenges toward obtaining reliable good-quality results have been identified as a contributing factor. Considerable progress has been made by the research community to address many of these challenges, and in this paper a consensus is presented on deficiencies in widely available MRS methodology and validated improvements that are currently in routine use at several clinical research institutions. In particular, the localization error for the PRESS localization sequence was found to be unacceptably high at 3 T, and use of the semi-adiabatic localization by adiabatic selective refocusing sequence is a recommended solution. Incorporation of simulated metabolite basis sets into analysis routines is recommended for reliably capturing the full spectral detail available from short TE acquisitions. In addition, the importance of achieving a highly homogenous static magnetic field (B               0               ) in the acquisition region is emphasized, and the limitations of current methods and hardware are discussed. Most recommendations require only software improvements, greatly enhancing the capabilities of clinical MRS on existing hardware. Implementation of these recommendations should strengthen current clinical applications and advance progress toward developing and validating new MRS biomarkers for clinical use.},

  abstract = {Aging is normally associated with increased predictability of neurophysiological processes. To test the related prediction of age-related increase in the Hurst exponent, H, of functional MRI time series, and its possible cholinergic mechanisms, two groups of healthy participants (old [mean age=65 years]; young [mean age=22 years]; N=11 per group) were scanned twice at rest, following placebo and a muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine 0.3mg. Older age was associated with significant increase in H of fMRI time series in bilateral hippocampus. Similarly, scopolamine was associated with increased H in left hippocampus; and there was an age-by-drug interaction in medial temporal lobe whereby older participants specifically had increased H following scopolamine. Scopolamine also enhanced fronto-hippocampal low-frequency coherence, and this could be correlated with its effect on hippocampal H. Thus, increased persistence of hippocampal dynamics in older subjects is demonstrable by resting fMRI; scopolamine mimics these effects, especially in older subjects, implying a cholinergic mechanism for age-related change; and cholinergic effects on hippocampal dynamics are associated with enhanced functional connectivity between frontal cortex and hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Fractal processes, like trees or coastlines, are defined by self-similarity or power law scaling controlled by a single exponent, simply related to the fractal dimension or Hurst exponent (               H               ) of the process. Multifractal processes, like turbulence, have more complex behaviours defined by a spectrum of possible local scaling behaviours or singularity exponents (               h               ). Here, we report two experiments that explore the relationships between instrumental and cognitive variables and the monofractal and multifractal parameters of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired in a no-task or resting state. First, we show that the Hurst exponent is greater in grey matter than in white matter regions, and it is maximal in grey matter when data were acquired with an echo time known to optimise BOLD contrast. Second, we show that latency of response in a fame decision/facial encoding task was negatively correlated with the Hurst exponent of resting state data acquired 30 min after task performance. This association was localised to a right inferior frontal cortical region activated by the fame decision task and indicated that people with shorter response latency had more persistent dynamics (higher values of               H               ). Multifractal analysis revealed that faster responding participants had wider singularity spectra of resting fMRI time series in inferior frontal cortex. Endogenous brain oscillations measured by fMRI have monofractal and multifractal properties that can be related to instrumental and cognitive factors in a way, which indicates that these low frequency dynamics are relevant to neurocognitive function.

However, there are limited studies into E/I imbalance at macroscale and its microcircuit-level mechanisms and clinical associations. In our current work, we computed the Hurst exponent---a previously validated index of the E/I ratio---from resting-state fMRI time series, and simulated microcircuit parameters using biophysical computational models. We found a broad reduction in the Hurst exponent in pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), indicative of a shift towards more excitable network dynamics. Connectome decoders pointed to temporolimbic and frontocentral areas as plausible network epicenters of E/I imbalance. Computational simulations further revealed that enhancing cortical excitability in patients likely reflected atypical increases in recurrent connection strength of local neuronal ensembles. Moreover, mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses revealed heightened E/I elevation in patients with longer disease duration, more frequent electroclinical seizures and inter-ictal epileptic spikes, and worse cognitive functioning. Replicated in an independent dataset, our work provides compelling             in-vivo             evidence of a macroscale shift in E/I balance in TLE patients that undergoes progressive changes and underpins cognitive impairments, potentially informing treatment strategies targeting E/I mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The past 25 years have seen a strong increase in the number of publications related to criticality in different areas of neuroscience. The potential of criticality to explain various brain properties, including optimal information processing, has made it an increasingly exciting area of investigation for neuroscientists. Recent reviews on this topic, sometimes termed brain criticality, make brief mention of clinical applications of these findings to several neurological disorders such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, and neonatal hypoxia. Other clinicallyrelevant domains -- including anesthesia, sleep medicine, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, and psychiatry -- are seldom discussed in review papers of brain criticality. Thorough assessments of these application areas and their relevance for clinicians have also yet to be published. In this scoping review, studies of brain criticality involving human data of all ages are evaluated for their current and future clinical relevance. To make the results of these studies understandable to a more clinical audience, a review of the key concepts behind criticality (e.g., phase transitions, long-range temporal correlation, self-organized criticality, power laws, branching processes) precedes the discussion of human clinical studies. Open questions and forthcoming areas of investigation are also considered.},

  abstract = {Short-TE proton MRS is used to study metabolism in the human brain. Common analysis methods model the data as a linear combination of metabolite basis spectra. This large-scale multi-site study compares the levels of the four major metabolite complexes in short-TE spectra estimated by three linear-combination modeling (LCM) algorithms. 277 medial parietal lobe short-TE PRESS spectra (TE = 35 ms) from a recent 3 T multi-site study were preprocessed with the Osprey software. The resulting spectra were modeled with Osprey, Tarquin and LCModel, using the same three vendor-specific basis sets (GE, Philips and Siemens) for each algorithm. Levels of total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), total choline (tCho), myo-inositol (mI) and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) were quantified with respect to total creatine (tCr). Group means and coefficient of variations of metabolite estimates agreed well for tNAA and tCho across vendors and algorithms, but substantially less so for Glx and mI, with mI systematically estimated as lower by Tarquin. The cohort mean coefficient of determination for all pairs of LCM algorithms across all datasets and metabolites was R2{\textasciimacron} = 0.39, indicating generally only moderate agreement of individual metabolite estimates between algorithms. There was a significant correlation between local baseline amplitude and metabolite estimates (cohort mean R2{\textasciimacron} = 0.10). While mean estimates of major metabolite complexes broadly agree between linear-combination modeling algorithms at group level, correlations between algorithms are only weak-to-moderate, despite standardized preprocessing, a large sample of young, healthy and cooperative subjects, and high spectral quality. These findings raise concerns about the comparability of MRS studies, which typically use one LCM software and much smaller sample sizes.},

  abstract = {J-difference-edited spectroscopy is a valuable approach for the in vivo detection of {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). A recent expert consensus article recommends linear combination modeling (LCM) of edited MRS but does not give specific details regarding implementation. This study explores different modeling strategies to adapt LCM for GABA-edited MRS. Sixty-one medial parietal lobe GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS spectra from a recent 3-T multisite study were modeled using 102 different strategies combining six different approaches to account for co-edited macromolecules (MMs), three modeling ranges, three baseline knot spacings, and the use of basis sets with or without homocarnosine. The resulting GABA and GABA+ estimates (quantified relative to total creatine), the residuals at different ranges, standard deviations and coefficients of variation (CVs), and Akaike information criteria, were used to evaluate the models' performance. Significantly different GABA+ and GABA estimates were found when a well-parameterized MM3co basis function was included in the model. The mean GABA estimates were significantly lower when modeling MM3co , while the CVs were similar. A sparser spline knot spacing led to lower variation in the GABA and GABA+ estimates, and a narrower modeling range-only including the signals of interest-did not substantially improve or degrade modeling performance. Additionally, the results suggest that LCM can separate GABA and the underlying co-edited MM3co . Incorporating homocarnosine into the modeling did not significantly improve variance in GABA+ estimates. In conclusion, GABA-edited MRS is most appropriately quantified by LCM with a well-parameterized co-edited MM3co basis function with a constraint to the nonoverlapped MM0.93 , in combination with a sparse spline knot spacing (0.55\,ppm) and a modeling range of 0.5-4~ppm.},
