    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3T multimodal MRI study of healthy adults (n=19; 10 female; 21-54 years) was performed to investigate the potential link between fMRI long-range temporal correlations and excitatory/inhibitory balance. The study objective was to determine if the Hurst exponent (HE) – an estimate of the self-correlation and signal complexity of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal – is correlated with the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) ratio. Findings in this domain have implications for neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions with disrupted E/I balance, such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease. From a methodological perspective, HE is also considerably easier to accurately measure than E/I ratio. If HE can serve as a proxy for E/I, it may serve as a useful clinical biomarker for E/I imbalance. Moreover, E/I has been proposed to serve as a control parameter for brain criticality, which HE is believed to be a measure of. Thus, understanding if HE and E/I are correlated would serve to clarify this relationship. The study collected movie-watching and rest data including fMRI – which was used to calculate HE – and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) – which was used to measure inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters – GABA and glutamate, respectively. HE was found to increase with movie compared to rest, while E/I did not change between conditions. HE and E/I were not correlated during either movie or rest. This study represents the first attempt to investigate this connection *in vivo* in humans. We conclude that, at 3T and with our particular methodologies, no association was found.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirty years ago, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) profoundly changed the world of MRI by allowing real-time analysis of pressing neuropsychological questions \\[@ogawaMagneticResonanceImaging1990; @ogawaBrainMagneticResonance1990; @stephanShortHistoryCausal2012\\]. While initially used to probe task-based responses, researchers have more recently developed an interest in studying brain function at rest, known as resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) \\[@decoRestingBrainsNever2013\\], i.e. to understand how brain dynamics at rest are related to neurological functioning as well as individual differences. A critical tool in analyzing these dynamics is the Hurst exponent (HE) \\[@campbellMonofractalAnalysisFunctional2022\\], a measure of self-similarity derived from the blood-oxygen-dependent (BOLD) signal. HE estimates the extent to which the BOLD signal displays long-term memory, where a higher value indicates a self-similar signal with long-term positive autocorrelations \\[@campbellMonofractalAnalysisFunctional2022; @beggsBeingCriticalCriticality2012\\]. Another way of understanding HE is that a signal with high HE is fractal: similar temporal signal fluctuations are observed, no matter the time scale \\[@campbellMonofractalAnalysisFunctional2022\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "HE has also emerged as a valuable tool in clinical research, capturing changes in BOLD signal dynamics across various neuropsychiatric conditions. In aging populations for instance, HE has been found to be elevated \\[@dongHurstExponentAnalysis2018; @winkAgeCholinergicEffects2006\\]; this relationship has also been found in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease \\[@maximFractionalGaussianNoise2005; @longBrainnetomeAtlasBased2018\\]. Additionally, changes in HE have been observed in conditions such as autism, mood disorders, and brain injury \\[@laiShiftRandomnessBrain2010; @donaTemporalFractalAnalysis2017; @weiIdentifyingMajorDepressive2013; @jingIdentifyingCurrentRemitted2017; @donaFractalAnalysisBrain2017\\]. These differences suggest HE may reflect changes in global and local functioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underlying these observations is the critical brain hypothesis, which posits that the brain operates at a critical point, a state where order and disorder are perfectly balanced to enable optimal information processing \\[@decoRestingBrainsNever2013; @beggsBeingCriticalCriticality2012; @barangerChaosComplexityEntropy2000; @bassettUnderstandingComplexityHuman2011; @zimmernWhyBrainCriticality2020; @liangExcitationInhibitionBalance2024; @poilCriticalStateDynamicsAvalanches2012; @lombardiBalanceExcitationInhibition2017; @baumgartenCriticalExcitationinhibitionBalance2019; @bruiningMeasurementExcitationinhibitionRatio2020; @trakoshisIntrinsicExcitationinhibitionImbalance; @gaoInferringSynapticExcitation2017; @tianTheoreticalFoundationsStudying2022; @rubinovNeurobiologicallyRealisticDeterminants2011\\]. When operating at a critical point, the brain is maximally sensitive to external stimuli, and can dynamically transition between ordered and disordered states to promote efficient cognitive processing \\[@decoRestingBrainsNever2013; @beggsBeingCriticalCriticality2012; @tianTheoreticalFoundationsStudying2022; @rubinovNeurobiologicallyRealisticDeterminants2011\\].Recent papers suggest the control parameter underlying the brain’s ability to transition between states is the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) ratio, the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity, often operationalized as the ratio of the primary excitatory-to-inhibitory neurotransmitters, i.e. glutamate-to-GABA ratio \\[@liangExcitationInhibitionBalance2024; @lombardiBalanceExcitationInhibition2017; @baumgartenCriticalExcitationinhibitionBalance2019; @bruiningMeasurementExcitationinhibitionRatio2020; @trakoshisIntrinsicExcitationinhibitionImbalance; @gaoInferringSynapticExcitation2017\\]. It is thought that E/I controls criticality by modulating the brain’s signal-to-noise ratio \\[@liangExcitationInhibitionBalance2024; @rubensteinModelAutismIncreased2003\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the implications to the critical brain hypothesis, understanding if E/I is related to HE may allow for easier estimation of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, as accurate E/I measurement is technically challenging \\[@ajramContribution1HMagnetic2019\\]. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the only non-invasive method of measuring the ratio of glutamate (excitatory) to GABA (inhibitory) *in vivo* \\[@stanleyFunctionalMagneticResonance2018\\]. Unfortunately, it has both limited spatial and temporal resolution \\[@gaoInferringSynapticExcitation2017; @ajramContribution1HMagnetic2019; @stanleyFunctionalMagneticResonance2018\\]. Consequently, if HE could serve as a proxy for E/I, it would be much easier to estimate E/I in conditions of interest such as autism, Alzheimer’s, and schizophrenia.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a handful of studies suggesting a link between HE and E/I, however they are all either computational models or animal studies \\[@liangExcitationInhibitionBalance2024; @poilCriticalStateDynamicsAvalanches2012; @lombardiBalanceExcitationInhibition2017; @baumgartenCriticalExcitationinhibitionBalance2019; @bruiningMeasurementExcitationinhibitionRatio2020; @trakoshisIntrinsicExcitationinhibitionImbalance; @gaoInferringSynapticExcitation2017\\]. Moreover, their findings are inconsistent, with some reporting positive linear, negative linear, or U-shaped relationships between the two variables (see @tbl-lit). Thus, there is a need for further study, both to clarify the nature of a potential E/I-Hurst relationship, and also to confirm if this relationship indeed exists in the human brain. Therefore, the current study seeks to investigate the potential E/I-Hurst relationship in vivo, within the visual cortex during movie-watching and rest.\n",
